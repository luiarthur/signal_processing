# To Do

- [x] Test Go
- [ ] Test c
- [ ] Test C++

# Conclusions:

- Java / Scala (too slow, run out of memory)
- R, python, Julia have comparable performance
    - in terms of speed: Julia > Python > R
- Need to test C, C++
- Go version 4 times slower...
- Try using Julia + Blink.jl (built on Electron) which enables HTML / JS / CSS. See [here][2]
- Julia seems easy and portable. (Just install Julia binaries)
