# To do

- [x] Figure out the spectrogram
- [x] Explore how the pitch detection at a given time point should work
- [ ] Make the functions for the complete spectrogram
- [ ] Make the functions for the local spectrogram as a function of the time interval
- [ ] Make a gui (in PyQT4) for the desktop app
- [ ] Try using Bokeh server in python

# 10 August

Left off with `spectrogram4.py`, `bokeh/index.html`, `arcPiano.html`.

Next thing: 
- [ ] use D3.js
- [ ] make a piano keyboard (flat)
- [ ] read text files (in `out/`) using D3.js
- [ ] when the audio plays at time `t`, highlight the keyboard at the key.
